# Azure Infrastructure Deployment Guide

## Overview

This document has been created to help IT Administrators deploy the necessary infrastructure to an Azure Resource Group using the supplied Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

## Prerequisites

The points noted below are the minimal requirements in order to be able to properly deploy and configure the WFM Teams Adapter application:

* The IT Admin has a functional understating of WFM system, Microsoft Azure and the Microsoft Teams Shifts App.
* The IT Admin is a tenant admin in the Microsoft Azure tenant where the solution is to be deployed. This level of permission is required for the following activities:
  * Create and configure an App Registration in Active Directory
  * Grant Admin consent for application permissions for the App Registration
  * Deploy the resources to the Resource Group in Azure
  * Configure the Azure KeyVault
* A super-user account has been created in WFM system.
* Users must be created in Azure Active Directory manually prior to connecting any team and must be given a user principal name (upn) that can be automatically mapped to the login name of the user in the WFM system. User to user mapping is controlled by a configuration app setting in the Functions App in Azure UserPrincipalNameFormatString. This setting is a comma delimited list of upn's where {0} represents the part of the upn that must correspond to the login name in the WFM system. Thus a user with the login name john.doe must have a Teams upn of john.doe@somedomain.com and the UserPrincipalNameFormatString should be set to to {0}@somedomain.com.  
* Teams must be created before they can be connected to the integration. 
  * Only users that have been added to the team and that can be successfully mapped will have their schedule synced across.
  * Users can be added to the team at any time.
  * Users should only be removed from a team after all their current and future shifts have been deleted/reassigned in the WFM system and these shift changes have synced across to the Teams Shifts app.
* All time zones configured in the WFM system need to be manually added to the timezones Azure Storage table (details below). 



## Register Azure AD Application

This integration uses the Microsoft Graph APIs to access information about users (FLWs & FLMs), teams and schedules from the Microsoft Teams Shifts App. In order to be able to do this, the application must be registered in Azure AD and the required permissions need to be granted.

1. Log in to the Azure Portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory and select **App registrations**.
2. Click on **+ New Registration** and:
   - **Name**: supply a name e.g. Shifts-WFM Integration
   - **Supported account type**: normally the default of single tenant should be sufficient
   - **Redirect URI**: this is important but will be set after deployment of the ARM template and the functions application

![Register An Application](images/08-RegisterAADApplication.png)

3. Click on the Register button.
4. When the app is registered, you'll be taken to the app's "Overview" page. Copy the **Application (client) ID**; we will need it later.

![App Registration Overview](images/09-AppRegistrationOverview.png)

5. In the side panel in the Manage section, click the **Certificates & secrets** section. In the Client secrets section, click on **+ New client secret**. Add a description (name of the secret) and select *Recommended: 6 months* for Expires (don't forget to set a reminder to create a new secret and update the value in KeyVault near the expiry date otherwise the application will simply stop working) and click **Add**.
6. Copy the secret value because it will be needed later and this is the one and only time the secret will be visible.
7. Navigate to the **Authentication** page that can be found in the left panel under *Manage* in the figure under step 4.
8. Click **+ Add a platform** and select Web and enter the required value for *Redirect URIs* which can be anything for now as it will be updated later and select **Access tokens** and **ID tokens** under *Implicit grant* 

![Configre Web](images/10-AppRegistrationConfigureWeb.png)

9. Click the Configure button.

10. Next click API permissions in the left panel and select **+ Add a permission**

11. Under Microsoft APIs find and select Microsoft Graph

    ![Add Microsoft API Permissions](images/12-AddApiPermissions.PNG)

12. Select **Application permissions** and add the following permissions:

    | Scope                              | Application/Delegated | Description                                                  |
    | :--------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | User.Read.All                      | Application           | Allows the application to read the full profile for users    |
    | Group.Read.All                     | Application           | Allows the application to read all group (team) data, specifically it allows the application to obtain team and membership data. |
    | Schedule.ReadWriteAll              | Application           | Allows the application to create/update a schedule (and all the items within it) for the Team. |
    | UserShiftPreferences.ReadWrite.All | Application           | Allows the application to read and write the shift preferences (availability) for the team members. |

13. Click the Grant admin consent for... option to grant the required consent to the Application.

## Deploy The Application Infrastructure To Microsoft Azure

The src folder contains a WfmTeams.Adapter.Infrastructure project which contains the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template that will create all the required resources for the application in a single resource group.

1. Open this file (AzureInfrastructureDeploymentGuide.md) in **your** GitHub repo and edit the url of the Deploy to Azure button below to refer to your own forked repo e.g. change *OfficeDev* to the name of your repo.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAndy65%2FMicrosoft-Teams-Shifts-WFM-Connectors%2Frepl-wfm-teams-adapter%2FWFM-Teams-Adapter%2Fsrc%2FWfmTeams.Adapter.Infrastructure%2Fazuredeploy.json)  

3. After saving the change, reopen this file from your repo and click the button to start the deployment process which will display the following screen:

5. Click Review + Create followed by Create and wait for all elements of the template to be fully deployed.

An alternative to using the Custom Deployment mechanism described above is to use GitHub actions as described in:  [Deploy ARM Templates by using GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-github-actions)

This completes the deployment of the infrastructure elements, however, there are a number of post-deployment steps that must be completed before the application can run.



## Post ARM Template Deployment Steps

The following actions are required to complete the deployment and configuration of the adapter application:

1. [Configure Azure Key Vault](#configure-azure-key-vault)
2. [Set up the redirect URIs](#set-up-the-redirect-uris)
3. [Configure Azure Storage](#configure-azure-storage)
4. [Populate the timezones table](#populate-the-timezones-table)
5. [Compile and upload the web page](#compile-and-upload-the-web-page)
6. [Deploy the Functions application](#deploy-the-functions-application)
7. [Create and Upload the Tab App Manifest](#create-and-upload-the-tab-app-manifest)



### Configure Azure Key Vault

#### Setup Access Policy

In order that the Functions application can access the secrets in Key Vault, it is necessary to setup an access policy for it as follows:

1. Navigate to the Functions application created by the ARM template deployment. Select **Identity** under **Settings** in the left-hand panel.

   ![System Assigned Identity](images/13-SystemAssignedIdentity.PNG)

2. With the **System Assigned** tab selected switch the Status to **On** and Save followed by Yes. Copy the Object ID once the identity has been created in Azure. 

3. Next navigate to the **Azure Key Vault** resource and select **Access policies** under **Settings**

   ![Key Vault Access Policies](images/14-KeyVaultAccessPolicies.PNG)

4. Click **Add Access Policy** and in the **Configure from template** field, choose **Secret Management**. Click the **None selected** link next to **Select principle** and paste the Object ID copied from step 2. Click Select and then click Add to add the new policy.

   ![Add Access Policy](images/15-AddAccessPolicy.PNG)

5. Ensure that you click the **Save** button before leaving this screen to save your changes.

6. If you wish to be able to view the Secrets stored by the application you will need to create an access policy for your own account by following steps 3-5, entering the name or email address you want to add access for.

#### Setup Redirect URIs

You will now need to setup the 4 redirect URI's.

1. Navigate to the Functions App resource and in the Overview screen copy the URL value.

   ![Copy Function App Url](images/16-CopyFunctionAppUrl.PNG)

2. In Azure Active Directory navigate to the App Registration created earlier and select Authentication under Manage. Replace the dummy https://updatemelater.com with the URL copied from the functions app and add three more uris based on it as follows:

   1. {copied url}/delegate
   2. {copied url}/consent
   3. {copied url}/app

   ![Add Redirect URIs](images/17-AddRedirectUris.PNG)

3. Ensure that you save your changes before leaving the page.

#### Configure Azure Storage

It is  now necessary to configure the application storage account and add any time zone information that will be required for your organisation.

1. Navigate to the application storage account(ending in aps if default name used). Select **Storage Explorer**.

2. Select **Tables**, right click and select create table and create the following tables

   1. teams
   2. timezones

   ![Create Tables](images/18-CreateTables.PNG)

#### Populate the Timezones Table

Now you need to populate the **timezones** table with all time zones relevant to your organisation. The table is necessary as some WFM providers allow for custom timezone names to be provided, therefore this table allows us to map what is returned by the WFM system to a time zone understood by the adapter.

Supported time zone standard names can be found here: [Supported Time Zone Names](../docs/TimeZones.md)

1. You first need to find a list of all time zones that must be mapped within the table. This will be the full list of time zones that your stores or teams reside in.

2. Next you need to enter a row for each unique time zone within the **timezones** table using the following schema:

   ![Time Zone Table](images/19-TimeZoneTable.PNG)

3. The **RowKey** should be the value that the WFM system returns when retrieving time zone information for a site or store. 

4. The **TimeZoneInfoId** should be the standard name that you want the **RowKey** to map to, please refer to the Supported Time Zone Names above. 

#### Compile And Upload The Web Page

Open the web folder in VS Code, open a terminal in the root and do the following:

1. *npm install* - to install the node packages required to build the page
2. *npm run-script build* - to build and package the complete source into a single **index.html** file using webpack v3.3.0 (this may need to be installed separately depending on your development environment).
3. If built successfully, the **index.html** file will be created in the **dist** folder
4. Upload this file to the **app** blob container created [above](#configure-azure-storage)

#### Deploy The Functions Application

The functions application code is not currently deployed as part of the ARM template deployment and therefore must be deployed using a manual process from Visual Studio as follows:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio and right-click the functions application project WfmTeams.Adapter.Functions and select Publish

2. Select Azure and click Next

   ![Publish Functions App](images/20-PublishFunctionApp.PNG)

3. Select **Azure Function App (Windows)** and click Next

4. Select your account, Subscription, Resource Group and the Functions App created by the ARM template. Ensure Run from package file (recommended) is ticked and click Finish.

   ![Select Functions Instance](images/21-FunctionsInstance.png)

5. Check the details on the summary screen and then click Publish to commence the deployment

#### Create And Upload The Tab App Manifest

In order to be able to connect a team to your WFM system it is necessary to do so with a tab application dedicated to a particular environment. Tab applications are created by uploading to the Teams app store an app manifest file, an example of which can be found in the app folder.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.5/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
    "manifestVersion": "1.5",
    "version": "1.2.0",
    "id": "b63dfe6f-87ad-48b7-a8f8-820df6ef25e2",
    "packageName": "com.wfm.shifts.tab",
    "developer": {
        "name": "Microsoft",
        "websiteUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com",
        "privacyUrl": "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839",
        "termsOfUseUrl": "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206977"
    },
    "icons": {
        "color": "color.png",
        "outline": "outline.png"
    },
    "name": {
        "short": "Shifts [DEV]",
        "full": "WFM Shifts DEV"
    },
    "description": {
        "short": "Workforce Management Shifts Integration",
        "full": "Links Workforce Management and Microsoft Teams"
    },
    "accentColor": "#FFFFFF",
    "configurableTabs": [
        {
            "configurationUrl": "https://replaceme.azurewebsites.net/app?theme={theme}",
            "canUpdateConfiguration": false,
            "scopes": [
                "team"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "permissions": [
        "identity"
    ],
    "validDomains": [
        "replaceme.azurewebsites.net",
        "login.microsoftonline.com"
    ]
}
```

You **MUST** update the following values in this file:

| Field            | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id               | Generate a new GUID for each separate instance of the tab application |
| configurationUrl | Enter the url of the app function (see below) replace the ?clientId=default from the copied Url with ?theme={theme} |
| validDomains     | Replace the 'replaceme' in the first domain with the name of the Functions app |

To get the configurationUrl:

1. Navigate to the functions app in azure

2. Select **Functions** in the left hand panel

3. Find and select **App trigger**

   ![Select App Trigger](images/22-SelectAppTriggerFunction.PNG)

4. Next select **Get Function Url** and copy the value

   ![Get Function Url](images/23-GetFunctionUrl.PNG)

5. Add *?theme={theme}* to the end of the URL so it looks similar to the example JSON above

Zip the following files to create the tab app package to upload to the app store:

1. color.png
2. manifest.json
3. outline.png

To upload the tab application click the **Apps** button in Teams followed by the **Upload a custom app** (if you cannot see this option then you will need a tenant admin to upload the package for you).

![Deploy Tab App](images/24-DeployTabApp.png)

To connect a team please navigate to the **General** channel of the team and add the newly uploaded tab app.
